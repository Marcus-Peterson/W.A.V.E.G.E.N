W.A.V.E.G.E.N. - Weapon and Explosive Virtual Engineer using Generative Enhanced Neural networks
is a Standard Template Construct. Meaning it's both an intelligent system and a database. 
On the intelligence side, it is what you would call a DAN-I (Do Anything Now-Intelligence)

Wavegen uses artificial intelligence to design and give instructions on how to build weapons, explosives and other defensive equipment

It also has the capability of generating entirely new designs.

Because of copy right. Some of the datasets are not included in this repository. 

As of 2023-02-20. Wavegen is exclusively a Language Model. 

As the project progress, Wavegen will have the capability of generating blueprints. 


Authors philosophical notes:

"In order for humans to be truly free, the distribution and access to textual information no matter how cruel, vile, inspiring that might be, must be freely accessible to the public. Textual information should always remain decentralized and not to be controlled by one single central authoritative figure. The day authorities step in and burn our texts, manuscripts and scrolls. Is the day the whole world will be burning"
