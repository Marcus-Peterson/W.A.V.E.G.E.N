W.A.V.E.G.E.N. - Weapon and Explosive Virtual Engineer using Generative Enhanced Neural networks
is a Standard Template Construct. Meaning it's both an intelligent system and a database. 

Wavegen uses artificial intelligence to design and give instructions on how to build weapons and explosives

It also has the capability of generating entirely new designs.

Because of copy right. Some of the datasets are not included in this repository. 

As of 2023-02-20. Wavegen is exclusively a Language Model. 

As the project progress, Wavegen will have the capability of generating blueprints.
